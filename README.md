For my algorithms project, I’d like to build a Traffic Control Simulator in Python. 
The plan is to use routing with Dijkstra/A* on a road graph. 
Lane-level traffic using a simple cellular automaton (Nagel–Schreckenberg–style) for stop-and-go behavior. 
Signal timing strategies (fixed-time vs. adaptive using queue length heuristics).
